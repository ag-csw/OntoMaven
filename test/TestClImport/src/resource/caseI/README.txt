Case I. A simple import, plus an extra titling statement that could cause inconsistency if it was imported (but it is not).

The directory /input holds the original corpus, with importations.
The directory /result holds a logically-equivalent corpus where all importations that are resolvable have been rewritten
in terms of XInclude statements.

We assume that all files at the top level (directly under /input or /result) constitute the corpus.
